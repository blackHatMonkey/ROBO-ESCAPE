# ROBO ESCAPE

## Introduction

## Implementation

## Lore
ROBO 3121 was suddenly teleported to another dimenstion and the only way to get
back to his world, Roboland, was to enter the wormhole located on the top
platform. However his journey will not be easy as he must overcome multiple
challanges to get home. Underneath some of the platforms are spikes that were
planted by the elven tribes. All though the elves were once peacefull they must
protect themselves in this unkown world and so they planted the spikes and tip
in poision. Therefore ROBO must avoid hitting them at all cost since even a scratch
can kill him. Another big hurdle that ROBO has to overcome is the giant virus
that tracks his position. Therefore ROBO has to be always on the move if he wants
to avoid getting consumed by it. ROBO also has to watchout for the lava pit on the
lower floors especially when jumping from platfrom to platfrom. In the sky ROBO
could see a bright yellow helicopter moving up and down. This helicopter is
piloted by captain KillerBee. He is the last of his platoon which were killed in a
struggle with the elves. He is now stuck in this world and all he could is just
move up and down and curse those elves. No one really knows anything about the
wormhole and whether entering it will actually get you out or it could just kill you.
That is why the elves scared of the idea decided to stay in this world rather than
risking it.
